Made this theme to make headers stand out more, this theme builds off from Blackout. 

To install this theme:

* Clone repo and move the move markdown monster - raven blue folder to C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Local\Markdown Monster\PreviewThemes

You can delete "markdown monster -" to make the folder name shorter. you dont have to though

* Inside that folder move vs2015.css to C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Local\Markdown Monster\PreviewThemes\scripts\highlightjs\styles

if you have markdown monster open, then restart and you should see "Raven Blue" or "markdown monster- raven blue" in the dropdown menu then select that.
